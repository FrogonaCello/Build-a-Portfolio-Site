## Instructions

Given was a Mockup, that was to be rebuild. If time and mood, the design could be extended and changed. I changed the Mockup to a page about some species of frogs and a recipe, how to impress someone that likes frogs through baking a frog cake. 

## Contributing

Contribution goes to the videos of UdacityÂ´s Nanodegree project, then the Review of my project. All photos are my own property. The further descriptions of the frog species are linked to Wikipedia and the recipe is from [Emilie](https://www.findingzest.com/frog-pond-cookie-cups/).
